## General Info
UML is graphical project for specifying, creating and documenting elements of information systems. It enables the standardization of how the system cross-sections are developed to include conceptual objects such as enterprise processes and system functions, as well as concrete objects such as classes programmed in a fixed language, database schemas, and reusable software components.
In this project, I presented an example application model for managing a chess catalog. This is Polish version.
